## Please answer the questions first!

**Is the feature request related to a visual bug?**

If it is, then please submit a **bug report** instead.

**Have you installed the Style Settings plugin and checked if Velocity already provides a toggle to enable the feature you want?**

If not, then please try that first.

**Are you requesting for Rainbow Folders or Colored Headings?**

Velocity will never support these features as a matter of opinionated design. Please ask around in the Obsidian Members Group Discord for CSS snippets so you can add these features yourself.

## Request

A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.
